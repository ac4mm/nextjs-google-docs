## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run server
# or
yarn run server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Use different tabs with same address, to see different users interact in same document.

## Goals
Learn Nextjs feature, using socket.io and Tailwindcss syntax.

## Final considerations
It is a demonstration mock, for the collaboration of multiple users on the 
same document, exploiting the potential of socket.io and the use of the components 
with the tailwindcss classes and the RTE component.
